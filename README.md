# ProjectJ
--DESCRIPTION--
A grocery list tracker where:
  users can store their groceries on a conventional list but also track how much remaining product they have left
  with this, we should be able to remind users when a product is low such that they can remember to buy more.

IDEAS:
  integration with e-receipts so that users do not have to manually input bought groceries
  recipe ideas for given groceries
